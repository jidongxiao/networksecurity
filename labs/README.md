# Environment Setup

In this course, every student needs to install 3 virtual machines on their own computer. The virtual machine images are from the SEED Labs, and this semester we will be using the Ubuntu 20.04 64 bit images.

You can find the images information [here](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/labsetup.html).
