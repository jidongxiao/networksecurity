# Lab Reports:

You need to submit a report for each lab. The report should be in a pdf format, and include the lab steps with one or more screenshot(s) for each step demonstrating you are completing the lab. At the end of the report, you need to provide one or two paragraphs of reflection: from an attacker's perspective, and/or from a defender's perspective. You can say something like, how attackers would take advantage of this technique, and what defenders can learn from here, or how they can protect themselves. Or how you yourself can change some of your daily practice. So you literally can say anything you want to say, either from attackers' point of view, or from defenders' point of view, or from both.

# Lab Grading: (/10pts)

you get all 10 pts if you submitted a report with a completed lab plus the reflection paragraph(s).

you get 8 pts if you submitted a report with a completed lab without the reflection paragraph(s).

In the rare case when you submitted a report with an incomplete lab, you get 5pts for the lab. And 2 more pts if you also have the reflection. ("incomplete" means you're half way but somehow get stuck. If you didn't make any attempt and didn't even start the first step, that's not incomplete, in that case, you don't get any pts for the lab).

You don't get any credits if do not submit a report or you submit the report after the due date.

# Due Date:

The due date for each lab is 7 days after the lab is presented in lecture. Late submission will not be graded.

# Submission:

To submit your lab report, just upload the report (a pdf file) on submitty.
