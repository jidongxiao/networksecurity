## Stateful Firewall:

- Connection Tracking: Stateful firewalls monitor the state of active connections. They keep track of the state of network connections (like TCP streams) and make decisions based on the context of the traffic.

- Context Awareness: Because they understand the state of a connection, stateful firewalls can allow or block packets based on their relation to established connections. For example, they can differentiate between a new connection request and a response to an existing connection.

- Performance: Stateful firewalls can be more efficient in handling established connections, as they don’t need to analyze every packet in detail for existing connections.

- Complex Rules: They can apply more complex rules based on the state of the connection, making them suitable for more sophisticated security requirements.

## Stateless Firewall:

- No Connection Tracking: Stateless firewalls treat each packet in isolation. They don’t keep track of the state of connections and only evaluate each packet against predefined rules.

- Simplicity: They operate on a simpler set of rules, which can make them easier to configure but less capable of handling dynamic traffic patterns.

- Performance: Stateless firewalls can be faster because they don't need to maintain state information. However, this can lead to more false positives or negatives in traffic filtering.
- Basic Filtering: They primarily perform basic filtering based on IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols without any awareness of the connection’s context.

## Summary:

Stateful firewalls are more advanced and provide better security by tracking connections, while stateless firewalls are simpler and faster but offer less context-aware filtering.
