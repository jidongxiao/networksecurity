## Why Socks

When configuring SSH dynamic port forwarding, the SOCKS protocol is chosen over HTTP or HTTPS for several reasons, including flexibility, versatility, and the nature of how the protocols work. Here's a breakdown of why SOCKS is preferred in this context:

1. SOCKS Works at a Lower Level

- SOCKS operates at the transport layer (layer 4), meaning it works at a lower level than HTTP or HTTPS, which are application-layer protocols. SOCKS can handle any kind of traffic, whether it's HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, or even custom protocols. It doesnâ€™t care about the content of the traffic; it just forwards it between the client and the server.

- HTTP/HTTPS, on the other hand, is designed specifically for web traffic (browsers) and only forwards HTTP or HTTPS data. It is limited to these protocols, so it wouldn't be able to handle non-HTTP traffic, like FTP or streaming data.

2. Protocol-Agnostic
- SOCKS is protocol-agnostic, meaning it can handle any kind of traffic (web, email, file transfer, etc.) without having to modify the traffic or inspect it. This makes it much more versatile for port forwarding.

- HTTP or HTTPS would require understanding and potentially modifying the traffic being forwarded, which is restrictive to web-only protocols.

3. Handling Different Types of Traffic

- SOCKS can handle both TCP and UDP traffic. This is particularly important because SSH dynamic port forwarding using SOCKS allows the redirection of various types of network traffic, such as DNS queries (UDP) or web traffic (TCP).

- HTTP/HTTPS primarily handles only TCP connections (typically web traffic). They are not built to handle other types of traffic (like UDP) effectively, limiting their use in forwarding.

4. No Content Alteration

- SOCKS does not need to inspect or modify the traffic, meaning it can forward any traffic, encrypted or not. It's simply a gateway or relay that routes packets from the client to the destination.

- HTTP proxies, in contrast, often modify or inspect the contents of the HTTP traffic. HTTPS adds encryption to the data, which is useful for privacy but introduces complexity if you want to inspect or modify the data without breaking encryption (man-in-the-middle attacks or SSL termination).

5. Encryption and Tunneling

- When you use SSH for dynamic port forwarding, SOCKS provides a secure, encrypted tunnel for your traffic, regardless of the protocol you're using. All traffic forwarded through SSH is automatically encrypted, whether it's HTTP, HTTPS, or anything else.

- HTTPS itself offers encryption for web traffic only, but using SOCKS over SSH allows you to tunnel any traffic securely, not just web traffic.

6. Ease of Setup

- Setting up SOCKS over SSH dynamic port forwarding is straightforward and supported by many tools and clients. It allows you to use one SSH command to create a dynamic proxy without needing to configure specific forwarding rules for each protocol, as would be necessary with HTTP or HTTPS proxies.

- Configuring an HTTP/HTTPS proxy, on the other hand, typically requires more setup, and is limited to web traffic.

7. Performance Considerations

- SOCKS is lightweight, and because it does not need to parse or modify the traffic, it typically introduces less overhead than an HTTP or HTTPS proxy, which might need to parse HTTP headers or encrypt/decrypt traffic at different stages.

## Summary

In summary, SOCKS is chosen for SSH dynamic port forwarding over HTTP/HTTPS because it is more flexible, protocol-agnostic, handles both TCP and UDP, and does not interfere with the traffic being tunneled. This makes SOCKS ideal for dynamic port forwarding, where various types of traffic might be routed securely through the SSH tunnel, not just web traffic.
