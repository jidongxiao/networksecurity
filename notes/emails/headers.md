- **To:**  
  Specifies the primary recipient(s) of the email.  
  Example: `To: jane.doe@example.com`

- **Subject:**  
  The subject line of the email, giving an overview of the message content.  
  Example: `Subject: Project Update`

## 3. **Technical Details in Headers:**

- **Received:**  
  Shows the route the email has taken, including IP addresses and mail servers. Each mail server adds its own "Received" header, starting from the sender’s server and ending at the recipient’s.

- **Return-Path:**  
  Specifies the bounce address or where undeliverable emails are returned.  
  Example: `Return-Path: <bounce@example.com>`

- **Message-ID:**  
  A unique identifier assigned to each email, useful for tracking.  
  Example: `Message-ID: <abc123@mail.example.com>`

- **DKIM-Signature:**  
  Part of email authentication, ensuring the email hasn't been tampered with during transit.

  Headers help identify delivery issues, spam filtering, and server delays.

- **Security:**  
  By analyzing headers, you can detect phishing attempts or other forms of email forgery.

- **Tracking:**  
  Headers are used to track the journey of an email, helping understand potential delays or issues.

## 5. **Analyzing Headers:**

- Always read email headers from the bottom up to follow the email's path.
- Look for anomalies, like mismatched server information, which could indicate spoofing or phishing attempts.
