# VPN Security Incidents

## 1. **NordVPN Data Breach (2019)**
In 2019, one of the largest VPN providers, **NordVPN**, confirmed that a server in Finland had been compromised. The attack allowed unauthorized access due to an insecure remote management system.

- **What happened?**  
  An attacker gained access to a server hosted by a third-party data center provider. Although no user credentials or personal information were compromised, the incident raised concerns about the trustworthiness of VPNs.

- **Impact:**  
  Even though no sensitive data was leaked, the breach damaged NordVPN’s reputation. This incident emphasized the need for regular audits and securing third-party data centers.

## 2. **Hola VPN's Botnet Scandal (2015)**
Hola VPN, a popular free VPN service, was found to be selling its users' bandwidth through its commercial arm, **Luminati**, effectively turning users into part of a **botnet**.

- **What happened?**  
  Users of Hola VPN unknowingly contributed their idle bandwidth to a network that could be rented out. Malicious actors exploited this, using Hola’s infrastructure for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

- **Impact:**  
  Users of Hola VPN were put at risk of being involved in cyberattacks without their knowledge, highlighting the potential risks of using free VPN services.

## 3. **UFO VPN Logging Incident (2020)**
UFO VPN claimed to have a strict no-logs policy but was found storing **plain-text logs** of user activity, including personal information and IP addresses, on an exposed database.

- **What happened?**  
  A database containing 894 GB of user logs was left exposed online. Despite UFO VPN’s claim that it did not store logs, this incident proved otherwise.

- **Impact:**  
  The breach exposed sensitive user data and revealed the company's false claims about its logging policies, eroding trust in VPN providers that advertise no-logs policies.

## 4. **Pulse Secure VPN Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (2021)**
**Pulse Secure**, a widely-used enterprise VPN solution, suffered multiple zero-day vulnerabilities that allowed attackers to breach corporate networks.

- **What happened?**  
  State-sponsored actors exploited vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure VPN, allowing unauthorized access to networks of defense contractors, government agencies, and financial institutions.

- **Impact:**  
  These attacks led to data breaches in critical sectors, underscoring the risks of unpatched VPN vulnerabilities and their potential exploitation by advanced threat actors.

## 5. **Fortinet VPN Credential Leak (2021)**
A list of **nearly 500,000 VPN credentials** stolen from **Fortinet** VPN devices was leaked on a hacker forum.

- **What happened?**  
  Attackers exploited a known vulnerability in Fortinet VPN devices, stealing login credentials and then publicly sharing them.

- **Impact:**  
  Organizations using Fortinet VPN were forced to reset credentials and secure their networks, as attackers could use the leaked credentials to access corporate systems.

## 6. **ProtonVPN’s Domain Fronting Controversy (2018)**
In 2018, **ProtonVPN** and **ProtonMail** were blocked in Russia after authorities accused them of using **domain fronting** to bypass censorship.

- **What happened?**  
  ProtonVPN used domain fronting to hide VPN traffic as it passed through major content delivery networks (CDNs). This technique allowed ProtonVPN users to evade censorship in countries with heavy internet restrictions.

- **Impact:**  
  The controversy highlighted how VPN providers sometimes use controversial techniques to bypass national censorship, which can lead to legal and political pushback from governments.

## 7. **CyberGhost VPN Vulnerability (2018)**
CyberGhost, a popular VPN service, was found to have a vulnerability that exposed its **client configuration files**, potentially allowing man-in-the-middle attacks.

- **What happened?**  
  A security researcher discovered that CyberGhost’s client configuration files could be manipulated by an attacker to intercept traffic between the user and the VPN server.

- **Impact:**  
  Although quickly patched, this vulnerability demonstrated that even well-known VPN providers could have critical flaws that compromise user security.

## 8. **Windscribe VPN Server Seizure (2021)**
In 2021, Windscribe VPN had several of its **servers seized** by Ukrainian authorities because they were improperly configured and stored **unencrypted** OpenVPN keys.

- **What happened?**  
  The servers were seized as part of an investigation, and since they contained unencrypted keys, they could potentially be used to intercept traffic from Windscribe users.

- **Impact:**  
  Windscribe faced significant criticism for failing to properly configure their servers, which highlighted the importance of encryption even at the server level.

## 9. **SuperVPN Data Leak (2022)**
**SuperVPN**, a free VPN app with millions of users, had a massive data leak where **360 million user records** were exposed online, including personally identifiable information (PII) and payment details.

- **What happened?**  
  The data breach exposed user email addresses, geolocation, IP addresses, and device information due to a poorly secured database.

- **Impact:**  
  The incident raised significant concerns about the privacy practices of free VPN services, which often lack the resources to secure user data properly.

## 10. **PureVPN's Logging Controversy (2017)**
PureVPN, which advertised itself as a **no-logs VPN**, was found to have provided **user logs** to the FBI during a criminal investigation, despite their no-logs policy.

- **What happened?**  
  In a cyberstalking case, PureVPN handed over logs that helped identify the suspect, contradicting their claims of keeping no logs.

- **Impact:**  
  This incident undermined PureVPN’s credibility and led to increased scrutiny of VPN providers’ claims regarding no-logging policies.
