# VPNs vs. SSH Tunnels

Why VPN is better than SSH Tunnels

## 1. Full Network Traffic Encryption

### VPN:
- **What It Does:** A VPN encrypts all network traffic coming from your device, including web browsing, streaming, gaming, and any application that uses the internet.
- **Example:** If you are connected to a public Wi-Fi network, using a VPN ensures that all your internet activities (like browsing, using apps, etc.) are encrypted and secure from eavesdropping.

### SSH Tunnel:
- **What It Does:** An SSH tunnel encrypts only specific traffic that you manually configure to go through the tunnel (typically for specific applications or services).
- **Example:** If you set up an SSH tunnel to forward a port for a specific application, only the traffic from that application is encrypted. Other internet activities, like web browsing, remain unprotected.

## 2. Bypassing Geo-Restrictions for All Applications

### VPN:
- **What It Does:** VPNs allow users to connect to servers in different countries, enabling them to bypass geo-restrictions for any online service or website.
- **Example:** If you're in a country where certain streaming services are blocked, connecting to a VPN server in a different country allows you to access that service as if you were in that location.

### SSH Tunnel:
- **What It Does:** SSH tunnels can also help with bypassing restrictions, but only for the specific applications configured to use the tunnel.
- **Example:** If you tunnel your web browser through an SSH connection, only that browser traffic is bypassed. Other apps or services wonâ€™t benefit from the tunnel unless configured specifically.

## 3. Network Layer Security for All Devices

### VPN:
- **What It Does:** VPNs can be set up on routers, allowing all devices connected to that router to benefit from encrypted traffic without individual configurations.
- **Example:** If you set up a VPN on your home router, every device (phones, tablets, smart TVs) connected to that router automatically has its traffic encrypted.

### SSH Tunnel:
- **What It Does:** SSH tunnels are generally set up on a per-application basis and do not extend to all devices on a network.
- **Example:** If you set up an SSH tunnel on your laptop to secure your SSH connection to a server, it won't protect traffic from your smartphone or other devices on the same network unless you configure SSH tunnels for each device.

## 4. Integrated DNS Leak Protection

### VPN:
- **What It Does:** Many VPN services provide features like DNS leak protection, which ensures that DNS queries are routed through the VPN, preventing leaks of your browsing activity.
- **Example:** If you're browsing the web with a VPN, even your DNS requests are encrypted, preventing your ISP from knowing which websites you're visiting.

### SSH Tunnel:
- **What It Does:** SSH tunnels do not inherently protect DNS queries. Unless explicitly routed, DNS queries may leak outside the tunnel.
- **Example:** If you set up an SSH tunnel for a specific application without routing DNS through it, DNS requests may still go through your ISP, exposing your browsing activity.

## 5. Ease of Use for Non-Technical Users

### VPN:
- **What It Does:** Most VPNs come with user-friendly apps that require minimal technical knowledge to set up and use.
- **Example:** A user can download a VPN application, log in, and click a button to connect without needing to configure anything else.

### SSH Tunnel:
- **What It Does:** Setting up an SSH tunnel typically requires command-line knowledge and manual configuration for each application you want to protect.
- **Example:** A user would need to use terminal commands to create an SSH tunnel and specify which local port to forward, which can be complex for non-technical users.

## Summary

In summary, VPNs provide comprehensive security for all network traffic across all devices, facilitate easy bypassing of geo-restrictions for any application, and offer user-friendly interfaces. In contrast, SSH tunnels are more limited in scope, securing only specific applications or services, requiring technical knowledge for setup, and lacking built-in features like DNS leak protection. If you need all-around protection and ease of use, a VPN is usually the better choice.
