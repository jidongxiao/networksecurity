## DHCP Security

DHCP has several security vulnerabilities that can be exploited in various attacks. Some of the common security problems and potential attacks associated with DHCP include:

1. DHCP Spoofing Attack

- Attack Overview: In a DHCP spoofing attack, a malicious actor sets up a rogue DHCP server on the network. When devices request IP addresses, the rogue server responds with its own configuration, which can include malicious DNS servers or a default gateway pointing to an attackerâ€™s machine.

- Impact: This allows attackers to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, redirect traffic, or intercept sensitive data.

2. DHCP Starvation Attack

- Attack Overview: In this attack, the attacker floods the DHCP server with a large number of DHCP requests, using spoofed MAC addresses. The server eventually runs out of available IP addresses, preventing legitimate devices from obtaining an IP address.

- Impact: This results in a Denial of Service (DoS), where new devices cannot join the network because the DHCP server is unable to allocate IP addresses.

3. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack

- Attack Overview: Attackers can use DHCP to inject themselves into the network by setting a rogue gateway or DNS server. By acting as a middleman, they can capture, modify, or redirect traffic.

- Impact: Attackers can intercept private communications, steal credentials, or modify data in transit.

4. DHCP Information Disclosure

- Attack Overview: Attackers can collect network configuration details, such as IP addresses, default gateway, DNS servers, and network topology, from DHCP requests and responses.

- Impact: This information can be used in further attacks, such as network mapping or reconnaissance.

5. DHCP Relay Spoofing

- Attack Overview: DHCP relay spoofing involves attackers intercepting DHCP messages between a DHCP client and a DHCP server. Attackers can relay these messages with altered content to misconfigure clients.
- Impact: This can result in misdirected traffic or network misconfigurations that can disrupt services or lead to traffic interception.

6. Unauthorized DHCP Client Attack

- Attack Overview: Malicious devices on a network can send unauthorized DHCP requests, consuming IP addresses and potentially getting onto the network without authorization.

- Impact: This can lead to network congestion, unauthorized access, or IP address exhaustion.

## Mitigation Strategies

- DHCP Snooping: Configuring switches to use DHCP snooping helps to prevent unauthorized DHCP servers from responding to DHCP requests.

- IP Address Reservations: Using IP reservations or limiting the pool of dynamic IP addresses reduces the potential for DHCP starvation attacks.

- MAC Address Filtering: Only allowing devices with pre-approved MAC addresses to receive IP addresses can help mitigate unauthorized client attacks.

- Secure Configuration: Using proper authentication and network segmentation can help reduce the risk of DHCP-based attacks.

By securing DHCP configurations and applying network security best practices, organizations can mitigate many of the risks associated with these attacks.
