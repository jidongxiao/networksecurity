# Network Protocols Used by Printers

Printers connected to a network utilize various protocols for communication, configuration, and job management. Below is a list of common network protocols used by printers:

## 1. **IPP (Internet Printing Protocol)**
   - **Description**: IPP is a network printing protocol that allows printers and clients to send print jobs over the Internet or local networks. It supports administrative tasks such as checking printer status and canceling jobs.
   - **Port**: Typically uses port 631 (TCP).
   - **Use Case**: Modern network printing, including printing over the internet, and supports encryption (using HTTPS).

## 2. **LPR/LPD (Line Printer Remote/Daemon)**
   - **Description**: LPR allows a client to send print jobs to a printer or print server using a queue-based system. It is an older protocol.
   - **Port**: Port 515 (TCP).
   - **Use Case**: Primarily used in Unix/Linux systems, but also available on other platforms.

## 3. **JetDirect (RAW or Port 9100)**
   - **Description**: JetDirect, also known as port 9100 printing, is a protocol developed by HP that allows direct print job sending via a raw socket connection.
   - **Port**: Port 9100 (TCP).
   - **Use Case**: Common with HP printers and many others that support raw socket printing.

## 4. **SMB (Server Message Block) / CIFS (Common Internet File System)**
   - **Description**: SMB is a file-sharing protocol used for sharing printers and files over Windows networks.
   - **Port**: Ports 445 (TCP) or 139 (TCP).
   - **Use Case**: Network printer sharing in Windows environments.

## 5. **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**
   - **Description**: SNMP is used for monitoring and managing network devices, including printers. It provides information such as toner levels and paper jam alerts.
   - **Port**: Ports 161 (UDP) for queries, 162 (UDP) for traps.
   - **Use Case**: Network monitoring and management of printers.

## 6. **HTTP/HTTPS**
   - **Description**: Many printers have web-based interfaces accessible via HTTP or HTTPS for configuration and status checks.
   - **Port**: Port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).
   - **Use Case**: Accessing the printer's web-based management console.

## 7. **Bonjour/mDNS (Multicast DNS)**
   - **Description**: Bonjour is Apple's zero-configuration networking protocol that allows devices to automatically discover printers and other services on local networks.
   - **Port**: Port 5353 (UDP).
   - **Use Case**: Printer discovery on local networks, particularly in macOS environments.

## 8. **WSD (Web Services for Devices)**
   - **Description**: WSD is a Microsoft protocol for automatic discovery and interaction with network devices, including printers.
   - **Port**: Uses dynamic ports via HTTP (TCP).
   - **Use Case**: Automatic printer discovery in Windows environments.

## 9. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**
   - **Description**: Some printers support FTP for uploading print jobs or downloading scanned files, though this is less common today.
   - **Port**: Port 21 (TCP).
   - **Use Case**: Sending print jobs or retrieving scanned documents.

## 10. **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**
   - **Description**: Some multifunction printers (MFPs) can send scanned documents via email using SMTP.
   - **Port**: Port 25 (TCP) or 587 (TCP) for secure submission.
   - **Use Case**: Sending scanned documents as email attachments.

## 11. **AirPrint**
   - **Description**: AirPrint is Apple's protocol for printing from iOS and macOS devices without needing printer-specific drivers. It works over IPP and uses Bonjour for discovery.
   - **Port**: Works over IPP (port 631) and mDNS (port 5353).
   - **Use Case**: Wireless printing from Apple devices.

Each of these protocols plays a role in how printers communicate with other systems on the network, enabling print jobs, printer management, and additional services like scanning and emailing. Proper configuration and security of these protocols are essential to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
