# Common Printer Control and Page Description Languages

Printers use a variety of control and page description languages (PDLs), depending on their manufacturer, model, and the specific tasks they perform. Below is a list of the most common ones:

## 1. **PCL (Printer Command Language)**
- Developed by HP, PCL is one of the most widely used languages for controlling print jobs and formatting documents. It has evolved through several versions (PCL 1 to PCL 6).
- **Use**: General-purpose printing, especially in office environments.

## 2. **PostScript**
- Developed by Adobe, PostScript is a page description language that is device-independent, meaning it can be used across different printers.
- **Use**: High-quality graphics and professional publishing.

## 3. **PDF (Portable Document Format)**
- While not traditionally a printer language, PDF has become a common format for printing, especially in networked and cloud printing environments. Many printers now natively support PDF as a print format.
- **Use**: Document exchange, digital printing, and publishing.

## 4. **PJL (Printer Job Language)**
- PJL is a control language that works alongside PCL or PostScript to manage job-level settings, such as selecting print languages, setting print environment variables, and controlling the printer's behavior.
- **Use**: Printer job management and control at a higher level than PDLs.

## 5. **ESC/P (Epson Standard Code for Printers)**
- Developed by Epson, ESC/P is a control language used for driving impact and inkjet printers. It's optimized for dot-matrix and inkjet printing.
- **Use**: Mostly used by Epson printers for controlling various print operations.

## 6. **GDI (Graphical Device Interface)**
- Used by Windows systems, GDI doesnâ€™t generate a file that the printer interprets directly. Instead, the computer performs the rendering, and the printer simply outputs the rasterized image.
- **Use**: Basic printing in Windows environments where the computer handles most of the processing.

## 7. **XPS (XML Paper Specification)**
- Developed by Microsoft, XPS is a page description language and a direct competitor to PDF. It is used for printing on Windows-based systems.
- **Use**: Printing documents with high visual fidelity, mostly on Windows platforms.

## 8. **ZPL (Zebra Programming Language)**
- A specialized language used for label printers, developed by Zebra Technologies. ZPL commands are used to control label formatting and barcodes.
- **Use**: Label printing, especially in industrial and logistics applications.

## 9. **CPCL (Comtec Printer Control Language)**
- Another specialized language for label and mobile printers, used primarily by Zebra and other label printing devices.
- **Use**: Mobile and label printing.

## 10. **HPGL (Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language)**
- A vector graphics language used to send commands to plotters and some high-end printers.
- **Use**: Plotters and some printers that handle complex vector graphics.

## 11. **IPP (Internet Printing Protocol)**
- While primarily a protocol, IPP can also handle print job formatting and submission, especially in network and cloud environments.
- **Use**: Cloud and network printing, handling both communication and some document formatting.

## 12. **PCLm (Printer Command Language Mobile)**
- A newer, lightweight version of PCL, designed specifically for mobile devices and wireless printing.
- **Use**: Printing from mobile devices.

## 13. **DPL (Datamax Programming Language)**
- Used by Datamax label printers for controlling label layout, fonts, barcodes, and other printing features.
- **Use**: Label and barcode printing.

## 14. **UPL (Unified Printing Language)**
- An early printing language used by some manufacturers, but mostly obsolete.
- **Use**: Legacy printers.

## 15. **RTL (Raster Transfer Language)**
- A language that converts image data to a raster format, often used in inkjet printers.
- **Use**: Inkjet printing where image rendering is needed.

---

Printers can use a wide array of control languages, typically specific to their function and manufacturer. Some of the most widely used are **PCL**, **PostScript**, and **PDF**, while specialized printers like label printers may use languages like **ZPL** or **CPCL**. The exact language used depends on the printer's capabilities, the environment, and the types of documents being printed.
